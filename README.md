# Mask-Detection-ML

Face Mask Detector, is an execution of a face recognition model to check whether an individual is wearing a mask or not. In these difficult occasions, with COVID-19 spreading surrounding us, it is essential for us all to avoid potential risks coming with it. Everybody around the globe is being encouraged to wear a mask when they step out in the open. Our task, whenever sent effectively, can help guarantee the wellbeing of many individuals.

Our project utilizes OpenCV, Keras/Tensorflow to prepare an efficient learning model to label a face from a picture or a video stream as 'wearing a mask' or 'not wearing a mask', with an average 93 percentage accuracy. It includes two stages, preparing and usage. In the preparation stage, we load a database containing pictures of individuals with and without masks, and save the model to the disk.

This project has a wide range of applications from using it to detect if people are taking precautions against the pandemic, to identifying suspicious activities in places like an ATM, where most of these activities involve people hiding their faces using a cloth or a mask.
